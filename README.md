# Accessability-Refactor

This project is meant to serve as an introduction to applying introductory html semantics while improving the accessibility of the content.

# Motivation

Creating accessable website content is now an industry standard, and as we continue to be more inclusive as a global unit, making sure that our content is visible and accessable to all is of vital importance to ensure that information is available to as many people as possible.
